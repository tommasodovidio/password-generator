# Password Generator

## This WebApp allows a user to generate a password based on the lenth and types of characters they would like to include. There are criteria put in place to ensure that the password meets certain requirements (e.g., length, etc). Once the criteria are selected by the user, the function creates a random password for the user. 

**Included technologies / resources:**
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript

**Key Features:**
1. Prompts and alerts to enable user to select types of characters he/she would like to include in the password
2. Function to generate the password based on user input
3. A For loop to iterate over the password length from the options object, selecting random indices from the array of possible characters
4. A For loop to mix in at least 1 guaranteed, selected character
